          Whatâ€™s the backstory of this project?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-sm mt-6">
          After an assignment as UX/UI Designer of a company I found myself out
          looking for a new job. During my assignment Iâ€™d been working on this
          companyâ€™s website and app design. As I was looking for new jobs I
          realised that the market was tough so say the least and I needed to
          expand my own design portfolio in order to make myself an attractive
          designer for open positions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm mt-2">
          However, I found that figuring out a fake project to design and
          investigate was a tedious process until I started using ChatGPT for
          ideas. I then thought that I may not be along with this problem and
          decided to create a solution that just required some point-and-click
          actions to generate an idea.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm mt-2">
          And voilÃ , the random app idea generator was born! ðŸŒ±

        <SecondaryButton label="Try it out!" to="/generate" />
      </div>
    </div>
